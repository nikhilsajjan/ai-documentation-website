AI Experements as the name suggests the week was all about getting my hands dirty and getting used with AI to make fun little projects where I was creating a wide range of projects in very little time to quickly prototype them by just chatting with Claude Code this helped me to turn ideas into quick prototypes which would take at least a week to get at. This week helped me understand how can I turn an idea into a quick prototype in few hours to check and validate ideas. Since the course I have been using AI as a desk buddy to get things done who is also an expert in few subject matters.

For the end project of the week an app was created where the designer could create an app that let them use an open source platform that could let them tether their camera and click photos that could directly transfer the photos that they click in the computer connected this experiment was made to see how they could use open source platforms and make something that they can use when required. The experiment was an inspiration from on of the faculties where they created an app similar to this but for editing which their partner uses for faster editing.
