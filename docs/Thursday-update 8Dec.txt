> [Image #1][Image #2][Image #3][Image #4] go through these for the context of what I want to work on 

⏺ I see four identical images showing a stylized markdown document design featuring Apple's "Think Different" campaign text. The design shows:

  - Header styling: "# Think different" in teal/cyan
  - Subheader: "## Here's to the crazy ones." in purple
  - Numbered list: The misfits, rebels, troublemakers in green
  - Body text: In a warm tan/brown color
  - Emphasized text: "They push the human race forward" highlighted in yellow
  - Link reference: Markdown-style link at bottom in purple/blue

  This appears to be a markdown document preview icon with syntax-colored styling, displayed on a white document with a folded corner.

  What would you like to create based on this? Some possibilities:
  - A markdown preview component with this color scheme
  - A styled document/note-taking interface
  - A marketing/landing page with this typography style
  - Something else?

⏺ Got it. You've been building an AI Documentation Website for your CIID Interaction Design Program experiments. The project includes:

  Current features:
  - Interactive color-changing header (HSL based on cursor)
  - Experiment Archive with week/day dropdowns
  - Markdown document loading (morning/afternoon sections)
  - Dark/light mode toggle with localStorage
  - Python HTTP server

  Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JS, Python server, Press Start 2P + Courier New fonts

  The markdown preview images you shared show a specific syntax-colored styling approach - this looks like a design direction for how content should
   be displayed.

  What would you like to work on? Possibilities:
  1. Style the markdown rendering to match those colors (teal headers, purple subheaders, green lists, etc.)
  2. Add new features to the existing site
  3. Create new experiment documentation
  4. Something else entirely

  Let me know what you'd like to tackle.

⏺ This adds excellent context. Your project has evolved into a cassette player-themed UI for browsing experiments:

  Thursday Afternoon Additions:
  - Rotating tape reels with 12 spokes (conic-gradient)
  - Toggle functionality - click selected tape/track again to deselect
  - Green pulsing dot for "Now Playing" indicator
  - Fun empty state message: "📼 static noise... This part of the tape is still blank"
  - Mobile responsiveness - comprehensive fixes for 768px and 480px breakpoints
  - Image gallery - 3-column flexbox layout in markdown content
  - Dark mode color optimizations for cassette elements

  Key technical patterns:
  - CSS conic-gradients for reel spokes
  - innerHTML instead of textContent for markdown HTML rendering
  - Two-tier media queries (768px, 480px)
  - LocalStorage for dark mode persistence

  Now I have the full picture of your project. The markdown preview images you shared earlier show a styled document with syntax-colored elements
  (teal headers, purple subheaders, green lists, etc.).

  What would you like to work on next?

⏺ 1. Friday Week 1 documentation - full-day format (no morning/afternoon split)
  2. Full-day content styling - new CSS class with 800px max-height
  3. Interactive drag effect for header dots - cloth-like physics
  4. Dot intensity boost - 70% brighter when dragging
  5. Deployment discussion - GitHub Pages recommended

  The "Think Different" images the user shared earlier are now mentioned as a "thematic reference" - it seems like inspirational material that was
  reviewed.

  Now I have good context about the project. The user is building an AI experiments documentation website with a cassette player theme, interactive
  dot grid header with drag effects, and markdown documentation display.

  The user is showing me all this context - they likely want to work on something new or continue development. Let me wait for them to tell me what
  they want to do next.


  More context added. The November 23rd session introduced:

  New Features:

  1. Full-day documentation format - Friday uses a single scrollable section (800px max-height) instead of morning/afternoon split
  2. Interactive drag effect for header dots:
    - Click and drag creates a "cloth being pulled" effect
    - 2x influence radius when dragging (10 → 20 units)
    - Physics with pull strength of 3.5x
    - grab → grabbing cursor feedback
  3. Dot intensity boost - 70% brighter when dragging (capped at 1.0 opacity)
  4. Deployment - GitHub Pages recommended at https://nikhilsajjan.github.io/ai-documentation-website/

  The "Think Different" images you shared earlier are referenced as "thematic/inspirational material" in this doc.

  I now have a complete picture of your project:
  - Cassette player UI for experiment navigation
  - Interactive dot grid header with hover + drag physics
  - Markdown documentation with images
  - Dark/light mode
  - Mobile responsive
  - GitHub Pages deployment

  The "Think Different" campaign is explicitly mentioned as design philosophy inspiration.

  Now I have the full picture:
  - Week 1 sessions: Thursday morning + afternoon, Friday
  - Nov 23 updates: Friday doc integration, drag effects
  - Nov 24 updates: Single-week simplification, pixel cursor, layout refinements

  The user is giving me all this context before telling me what they want to work on. Let me summarize what I've learned and wait for their request.


  Great, the November 24th session focused on simplification and polish:

  Key Changes:

  1. Single-week cassette player - Removed tape selector, all days immediately accessible (60% fewer clicks)
  2. Display updates - Shows day names ("Monday") instead of track codes ("1:01")
  3. Cassette deck sizing - 210% height increase with spacing:
    - 16px top padding
    - 62px space between label and reels
    - 62px bottom padding
  4. Custom pixel cursor - docs/Pixel cursor.svg applied site-wide for retro aesthetic
  5. Design exploration - Created 4 options (Classic Clean, Modern Gradient, Brutalist Bold, Organic Glow), chose Option A
  6. "Think Different" as design philosophy - explicitly noted as inspiration for challenging conventional UI patterns

  Current State Summary:
  - Single-week cassette player UI
  - Interactive dot grid header (hover + drag physics)
  - Pixel cursor throughout
  - Day-based navigation (Mon-Fri)
  - Morning/afternoon content sections (or full-day for Friday)
  - Dark/light mode
  - Mobile responsive
  - GitHub Pages deployment ready

  Now I have complete context of your project's evolution. What would you like to work on today?

> /Users/nikhilsajjan/Documents/AI/personal/docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt use this document and add it to Friday part and name the section update1.0 

⏺ Read(docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt)
  ⎿  Read 1195 lines

⏺ The user wants me to add this document to the Friday section of their website, naming the section "update1.0".

  Looking at how the website works from the earlier documentation:
  - The Friday section currently uses a "full" property type (single section, not morning/afternoon split)
  - The docsMapping in index.html maps week/day to documentation files
  - Content is displayed in scrollable sections

  The user wants to:
  1. Add this Canon EDSDK conversation log to the Friday section
  2. Name it "update1.0"

  This means I need to:
  1. Read the current index.html to understand the docsMapping structure
  2. Modify the docsMapping to include this new file in the Friday section
  3. Possibly update the display logic if needed to show "update1.0" as a section name

  Let me read the index.html first to understand the current structure.


  This is a conversation log from a Canon EDSDK camera control project - building a macOS Swift app to control Canon cameras. It covers SDK setup,
  camera detection, live view, and various fixes for framework signing issues.

  Now let me add this to the Friday section of your website as "update1.0". First, let me check the current index.html structure:

⏺ Read(index.html)
  ⎿  Read 1652 lines

⏺ 1. The docsMapping object (lines 1208-1235) maps week/day to documentation files
  2. Currently Friday has only full: "docs/Friday-week 1.md"
  3. The updateContent() function handles different section types (morning, afternoon, full, updates, update1.2)

  The user wants me to add the Canon history document (canon_History_1Dec.txt) to the Friday section as "update1.0".

  I need to:
  1. Add "update1.0" to the Friday object in docsMapping
  2. Update the updateContent() function to handle the update1.0 property for Friday (similar to how Thursday handles updates)

  Looking at the current Friday section handling (lines 1389-1396), it only handles hasFull. I need to extend this to also check for and display
  update sections.

  Let me make the edits:
  1. Add "update1.0": "docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt" to the friday object in docsMapping
  2. Modify the Friday rendering logic to also check for and render update sections after the full content

  Now I understand the structure. I need to:
  1. Add the update1.0 entry to the Friday section in docsMapping
  2. Update the rendering logic to show update sections for Friday (similar to Thursday)

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 2 additions and 1 removal                       
       1222                        "update1.2": "docs/Updates-24Nov.md"
       1223                    },
       1224                    friday: {
       1225 -                      full: "docs/Friday-week 1.md"
       1225 +                      full: "docs/Friday-week 1.md",
       1226 +                      "update1.0": "docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt"
       1227                    }
       1228                },
       1229                week2: {

⏺ Now I need to update the rendering logic to handle update sections for Friday. Currently, the hasFull branch just renders the full content but
  doesn't check for updates. Let me update that:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 17 additions                                                                     
       1395    
       1396                    const content = await loadExternalContent(hasFull);
       1397                    section.innerHTML = content;
       1398 +  
       1399 +                  // Check for update sections in full-day content (like Friday)
       1400 +                  const hasUpdate10 = dayData["update1.0"];
       1401 +                  if (hasUpdate10) {
       1402 +                      const update10Section = document.createElement('div');
       1403 +                      update10Section.className = 'time-section';
       1404 +                      update10Section.innerHTML = `
       1405 +                          <details>
       1406 +                              <summary>Update 1.0</summary>
       1407 +                              <div class="time-content">Loading updates...</div>
       1408 +                          </details>
       1409 +                      `;
       1410 +                      contentSections.appendChild(update10Section);
       1411 +  
       1412 +                      const update10Content = await loadExternalContent(hasUpdate10);
       1413 +                      update10Section.querySelector('.time-content').innerHTML = update10Content;
       1414 +                  }
       1415                }
       1416            }
       1417    

⏺ Done. I've added the Canon EDSDK conversation log to the Friday section as "Update 1.0". Here's what I changed:

  Changes made to index.html:

  1. Added to docsMapping (line 1226):
  friday: {
      full: "docs/Friday-week 1.md",
      "update1.0": "docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt"
  }
  2. Updated rendering logic (lines 1399-1414):
    - Added check for update1.0 property in full-day content
    - Creates a collapsible "Update 1.0" section after the main Friday content

  Now when you select Friday on the cassette player, you'll see:
  - The main full-day content at the top
  - A collapsible "Update 1.0" section below containing the Canon EDSDK conversation log

  You can test it by running the server and clicking on Friday (track 5).

> make the earlier friday part as verzion 0. 

⏺ I'll restructure Friday to show the original content as "Version 0" and the Canon log as "Update 1.0", both as collapsible sections.

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 1 addition and 1 removal                        
       1222                        "update1.2": "docs/Updates-24Nov.md"
       1223                    },
       1224                    friday: {
       1225 -                      full: "docs/Friday-week 1.md",
       1225 +                      "version0": "docs/Friday-week 1.md",
       1226                        "update1.0": "docs/canon_History_1Dec.txt"
       1227                    }
       1228                },

⏺ Now I need to update the rendering logic to handle version0 and show both as collapsible sections:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 3 additions and 1 removal                                                                                       
       1292                const hasFull = dayData.full;
       1293                const hasUpdates = dayData.updates;
       1294                const hasUpdate12 = dayData["update1.2"];
       1295 +              const hasVersion0 = dayData["version0"];
       1296 +              const hasUpdate10 = dayData["update1.0"];
       1297    
       1298 -              if (!hasMorning && !hasAfternoon && !hasFull && !hasUpdates && !hasUpdate12) {
       1298 +              if (!hasMorning && !hasAfternoon && !hasFull && !hasUpdates && !hasUpdate12 && !hasVersion0 && !hasUpdate10) {
       1299                    contentSections.innerHTML = '<div class="experiment-content" style="text-align: center; padding: 2rem; 
              font-family: \'Courier New\', monospace;">📼 *static noise* ...<br><br>This part of the tape is still blank.<br>No experiments 
              recorded yet!<br><br>🎵 Try another track! 🎵</div>';
       1300                    contentDisplay.classList.add('active');
       1301                    return;

⏺ Now let me replace the old hasFull rendering logic with the new version0 + update1.0 logic:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 15 additions and 2 removals                                                  
       1397    
       1398                    const content = await loadExternalContent(hasFull);
       1399                    section.innerHTML = content;
       1400 +              } else if (hasVersion0) {
       1401 +                  // Version-based sections (like Friday)
       1402 +                  const version0Section = document.createElement('div');
       1403 +                  version0Section.className = 'time-section';
       1404 +                  version0Section.innerHTML = `
       1405 +                      <details open>
       1406 +                          <summary>Version 0</summary>
       1407 +                          <div class="time-content">Loading content...</div>
       1408 +                      </details>
       1409 +                  `;
       1410 +                  contentSections.appendChild(version0Section);
       1411    
       1412 -                  // Check for update sections in full-day content (like Friday)
       1413 -                  const hasUpdate10 = dayData["update1.0"];
       1412 +                  const version0Content = await loadExternalContent(hasVersion0);
       1413 +                  version0Section.querySelector('.time-content').innerHTML = version0Content;
       1414 +  
       1415 +                  // Add Update 1.0 section if it exists
       1416                    if (hasUpdate10) {
       1417                        const update10Section = document.createElement('div');
       1418                        update10Section.className = 'time-section';

⏺ Done. I've restructured the Friday section. Here's the new layout:

  Friday now shows:
  - Version 0 (collapsible, open by default) - Original Friday-week 1.md content
  - Update 1.0 (collapsible, closed by default) - Canon EDSDK conversation log (canon_History_1Dec.txt)

  Changes made:
  1. Renamed full to version0 in docsMapping
  2. Added rendering logic for version-based sections
  3. Both sections are now collapsible <details> elements

  When you click Friday (track 5), you'll see two collapsible sections instead of one continuous scroll area.

> the footer in mobile collapses check for it and optimise it 

⏺ Let me check the current footer mobile styles more closely:

⏺ Read(index.html)
  ⎿  Read 300 lines

⏺ I can see the issues. The mobile footer has problems with:
  1. Grid template rows not matching actual elements
  2. Button positioning issues
  3. The dark-mode-toggle inside footer-name causing layout conflicts

  Let me fix the mobile footer styles:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 11 additions and 11 removals                 
       948                }

       1124        </style>
       1125    </head>

⏺ Done. I've optimized the mobile footer. Here's what I fixed:

  At 768px (tablet/large phones):
  - Changed from broken grid to flexbox with flex-direction: column
  - Fixed ordering: name → divider → links
  - Centered text alignment for both sections
  - Properly positioned dark-mode-toggle with margin: auto
  - Added consistent padding and spacing

  At 480px (small phones):
  - Reduced font sizes (h3: 1rem, links: 0.7rem, buttons: 0.7rem)
  - Tighter padding (25px 15px)
  - Smaller button padding (8px 14px)
  - Proper centering for dark-mode-toggle

  Key fixes:
  - Removed the invalid grid-template-rows that had 5 values for 3 elements
  - Used flexbox which handles stacking more reliably
  - Buttons now center properly below their respective sections
  - Consistent spacing throughout

  The footer should now stack cleanly on mobile without collapsing.

> The header section background now works with mouse can there be a way it can be used with touch screens in mobile as well

       1710                e.preventDefault();

⏺ Done! I've added touch event support for mobile devices. Here's what I added:

  Touch Events:
  - touchstart - Activates dragging mode and captures initial touch position
  - touchmove - Tracks finger movement and calculates velocity (same physics as mouse)
  - touchend - Resets all states when finger is lifted
  - touchcancel - Handles interrupted touches (e.g., incoming call)

  Features:
  - Uses { passive: true } for better scroll performance
  - Same cloth-pulling effect as desktop (2x influence radius, 70% opacity boost)
  - Dots follow your finger and spring back when released

  Now when you touch and drag on the hero section on mobile, the dots will respond to your finger movement with the same interactive effect as the
  mouse on desktop.

> in mobile view lets reduce the size of dragged dots by 70% 

⏺ I'll add a mobile check and reduce the dot scale effect by 70% on smaller screens:

       1510            let aspectRatio = 1;
       1511            let time = 0;
       1512 +          let isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768;
       1513    
       1514            function updateAspectRatio() {
       1515                const rect = heroSection.getBoundingClientRect();

⏺ Now let me update the resize handler to also track mobile state:

       1515                const rect = heroSection.getBoundingClientRect();
       1516                aspectRatio = rect.width / rect.height;
       1517 +              isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768;
       1518            }
       1519            updateAspectRatio();
       1520            window.addEventListener('resize', updateAspectRatio);

⏺ Now let me modify the scale calculation to be 70% smaller on mobile:

       1569                        finalOffsetX = waveX + dot.targetX;
       1570                        finalOffsetY = waveY + dot.targetY;
       1571    
       1572 -                      scale = 1 + (1 - distance / influenceRadius) * 1.05;
       1572 +                      const scaleMultiplier = isMobile ? 0.315 : 1.05; // 70% smaller on mobile
       1573 +                      scale = 1 + (1 - distance / influenceRadius) * scaleMultiplier;
       1574    
       1575                        // Increase opacity by 70% when dragging
       1576                        if (isDragging) {

⏺ There's also another scale calculation for non-dragged hover. Let me update that too:

  ⎿  Updated index.html with 2 additions and 1 removal                                                               
       1592                        }
       1593                    } else {
       1594                        if (distance < 10) {
       1595 -                          scale = 1 + (1 - distance / 10) * 1.05;
       1595 +                          const hoverScaleMultiplier = isMobile ? 0.315 : 1.05; // 70% smaller on mobile
       1596 +                          scale = 1 + (1 - distance / 10) * hoverScaleMultiplier;
       1597                        }
       1598                        // Reset opacity for dots outside influence radius
       1599                        dot.element.style.opacity = dot.baseOpacity;

⏺ Done! I've reduced the dot scale effect by 70% on mobile. Here's what changed:

  Changes:
  - Added isMobile flag (true when viewport ≤ 768px)
  - Updates automatically on window resize
  - Scale multiplier:
    - Desktop: 1.05 (dots grow up to ~2x size)
    - Mobile: 0.315 (dots grow up to ~1.3x size - 70% smaller effect)

  Both the drag effect and hover effect now use the reduced scale on mobile, so the dots won't grow as large when you touch and drag them on smaller
   screens.

> reset the last done thing 

⏺ I'll revert the mobile dot scale reduction changes:

       1595                        dot.element.style.opacity = dot.baseOpacity;

⏺ Done. Reverted the mobile dot scale changes. The dots now scale the same (1.05 multiplier) on both mobile and desktop.

> what does influenceRadius do? 

⏺ influenceRadius controls how far from your cursor/finger the dots are affected.

  const influenceRadius = isDragging ? 20 : 10;

  What it does:
  - Defines a circular "zone of influence" around the cursor/touch point
  - Dots inside this radius: get displaced, scale up, and brighten
  - Dots outside this radius: only do the ambient wave animation

  Values:
  - Normal hover: 10 units (smaller area)
  - When dragging: 20 units (2x larger area, more dots affected)

  Visual effect:
  - Smaller radius = precise, focused interaction (fewer dots move)
  - Larger radius = broader, cloth-like effect (more dots move together)

  Think of it like touching water - influenceRadius is how wide the ripples spread from your finger.

> While dragging reduce the area by 50%

       1537    
       1538                    // Adjust influence radius based on dragging state
       1539 -                  const influenceRadius = isDragging ? 20 : 10;
       1539 +                  const influenceRadius = isDragging ? 10 : 10;
       1540    
       1541                    if (distance < influenceRadius) {
       1542                        const influence = (influenceRadius - distance) / influenceRadius;

⏺ Done. Reduced the drag influence radius by 50%:

  - Before: Dragging = 20 units, Hover = 10 units
  - After: Dragging = 10 units, Hover = 10 units

  Now when you drag, fewer dots will be affected (smaller, more focused area).

  - Dark mode support
  - Mobile responsive (stacks vertically on smaller screens)

  Note: You'll need to add a Claude Code image at docs/claude-code.png. If you have the image saved elsewhere or with a different name, let me know
  the path and I'll update it.

⏺ Now let me update the HTML to use both images:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 2 additions and 1 removal                                                                                         
       1258                    <p class="about-description">This week was all about exploring the boundaries of AI-assisted design and 
              development. Using Claude Code as our primary tool, we experimented with building interactive websites, creating animations, and 
              pushing the limits of what's possible when humans and AI collaborate on creative projects.</p>
       1259                </div>
       1260                <div class="about-image">
       1261 -                  <img src="docs/claude-code.png" alt="Claude Code - AI coding assistant">
       1261 +                  <img src="docs/claude code light.jpg" alt="Claude Code - AI coding assistant" class="light-mode-img">
       1262 +                  <img src="docs/claude code dark.webp" alt="Claude Code - AI coding assistant" class="dark-mode-img">
       1263                    <p class="image-caption">Built with Claude Code</p>
       1264                </div>
       1265            </div>

⏺ Now let me add the CSS to show/hide images based on mode:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 8 additions                        
       136                border-radius: 8px;
       137            }
       138    
       139 +          .about-image .dark-mode-img {
       140 +              display: none;
       141 +          }
       142 +  
       143 +          .about-image .light-mode-img {
       144 +              display: block;
       145 +          }
       146 +  
       147            .image-caption {
       148                font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
       149                font-size: 0.8rem;

⏺ Now let me add the dark mode CSS to swap the images:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 8 additions                           
       678                border-color: #555;
       679            }
       680    
       681 +          body.dark-mode .about-image .dark-mode-img {
       682 +              display: block;
       683 +          }
       684 +  
       685 +          body.dark-mode .about-image .light-mode-img {
       686 +              display: none;
       687 +          }
       688 +  
       689            body.dark-mode .image-caption {
       690                color: #888;
       691            }

⏺ Done! I've updated the About section:

  Changes:
  - Made section full height (min-height: 100vh) - same as hero section
  - Centered content vertically and horizontally
  - Added both images:
    - claude code light.jpg - shows in light mode
    - claude code dark.webp - shows in dark mode
  - Images swap automatically when toggling dark/light mode

  The About section now matches the hero section's height and displays the appropriate Claude Code image based on the current theme.

> increase the font size of content text and shift the image bellow the content text 

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 4 additions and 2 removals         
       102                max-width: 900px;
       103                margin: 0 auto;
       104                display: flex;
       105 -              gap: 50px;
       105 +              flex-direction: column;
       106 +              gap: 40px;
       107                align-items: center;
       108 +              text-align: center;
       109            }
       110    
       111            .about-content {
     ...
       119    
       120            .about-description {
       121                font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
       122 -              font-size: 1rem;
       122 +              font-size: 1.25rem;
       123                color: #444;
       124                line-height: 1.8;
       125            }

⏺ Now let me update the mobile styles since the layout is now stacked by default:

       1111 -                  font-size: 0.9rem;
       1111 +                  font-size: 1.1rem;
       1112                }
       1113    
       1114                .about-image img {

⏺ Update(index.html)

       1206 -                  font-size: 0.85rem;
       1206 +                  font-size: 1rem;
       1207                }
       1208    
       1209                .about-image img {

⏺ Done! Changes made:

> in mobile the view the first folds dots orrientation changes from vertical to horizontal, even in mobile keep it in vertical 

⏺ The issue is that on mobile (portrait mode), the hero section is much taller than wide (100vh is tall, but width is narrow),
  which stretches the dot grid. Let me fix this by adjusting the hero section height on mobile:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 5 additions         
       1031                    font-size: 0.9rem;
       1032                }
       1033    
       1034 +              .hero-section {
       1035 +                  min-height: 100vw;
       1036 +                  max-height: 100vh;
       1037 +              }
       1038 +  
       1039                .content-display {
       1040                    padding: 20px;
       1041                }

⏺ Let me also add this for smaller phones:

⏺ Update(index.html)
  ⎿  Updated index.html with 5 additions          
       1187                    font-size: 0.85rem;
       1188                }
       1189    
       1190 +              .hero-section {
       1191 +                  min-height: 100vw;
       1192 +                  max-height: 100vh;
       1193 +              }
       1194 +  
       1195                .content-box {
       1196                    padding: 20px 25px;
       1197                }

⏺ Done! I've fixed the dot grid orientation on mobile by:

  Changes:
  - Set min-height: 100vw on mobile - makes the section height equal to viewport width (creates a square-ish area)
  - Set max-height: 100vh - caps it at viewport height

  This ensures the hero section maintains a more square aspect ratio on mobile portrait mode, so the dots keep their vertical
  orientation instead of stretching horizontally.

  Applied to both:
  - Tablet (768px breakpoint)
  - Small phones (480px breakpoint)
